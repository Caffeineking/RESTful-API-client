# AtomicPay REST API
AtomicPay provides a standard HTTP RESTful interface which enables application developers to programmatically interact with their account in a powerful, yet secure environment. Using the AtomicPay API, clients can create and manage invoices, retrieve transaction information, access features, retrieve real-time currency rates, manage bills, and much more.

Developers do not need to install additional libraries or softwares. Developers may call the API directly over HTTPS via protocol methods GET, PUT, POST and DELETE to perform operations, using the language of their choice.
